Random side project i started a lil while back

added more and more stuff from time to time

made 2 custom types so far-

1. UNumber (custom type for arbitrary precision large numbers)
2. Matrix (a custom type that represents mathematical matricies)

ill mabye add more types later

feel free to play around with these

these types arent really optimized. I honestly just made them to learn more about operator overloading and making custom types in Rust. If you want to optimize stuff feel free to make a PR

thats rlly it
